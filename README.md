# Pokémon Breed Simulator

This is an ongoing project to create a Pokémon breeding system for PokeMMO. It started as a project in Google Script and is being converted to JavaScript and, subsequently, TypeScript.

## Project Objectives

The main goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive tool for Pokémon breeding in PokeMMO, allowing players to simulate and explore different parent combinations to obtain Pokémon with desired traits and IV's. Additionally, the project aims to:

- **Integration with PokeMMO:** Ensure that the system seamlessly integrates with PokeMMO so that players can use the generated information directly in the game.

- **Google Sheets Support:** In addition to in-game integration, we also plan to provide a version that works with Google Sheets to facilitate breeding planning and tracking.

- **Modular Architecture:** We intend to separate the project's logic into independent modules, allowing specific parts to be used as microservices, and in other contexts if needed.

- **Support for User-Customized Pokémon Database:** One of the unique features of this project is the ability to use a user-customized Pokémon database, providing a personalized experience for players. To ensure accessibility and flexibility, we also offer the option to store this data in Google Sheets if external storage is not feasible or if users prefer a cloud-based solution. Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of providing hosting services for this data, but the specifics, including size limitations and costs, are currently under consideration.

## Project Status

As of now, the project is approximately halfway through its development cycle. While many core features have been successfully implemented and tested, there is still ongoing work to further enhance and refine the tool. We are dedicated to creating a robust and valuable resource for the PokeMMO community.

Additionally, it's worth noting that all features related to Google Sheets integration have been completed or are in advanced stages of development, depending on your perspective. However, some issues persist with the viewing aspect of this integration, which we are actively addressing.
